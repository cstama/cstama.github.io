		it is finally that time it is time for it now and it shall be revealed
		please join me and myself and the individual which so happens to be i
		in the great establishment that is opening
		yes! the grand opening of said establishment is happening soon
		and within that beforehand which it is not open it shall be in progress-
		a process which requires the need to be set up, organized, arranged, rearranged,
		sorted out, classified, categorized, grouped, ungrouped,
		and systematically and algorithmically positioned
		but when the actions and operations leading up to the finality
		of the final conclusion are completed and finished you may be able to partake
		in the larger scheme of the entire thing which will exist
		as you are, i am, and the rest of everyone and everything else does as well
		but right up until that point in time it will not be finished
		and i hope you happen to be as excited for this as i am explaining this to you
		because this fine establishment, this formation of business shall include you,
		you there and you there, with me there, there as i am
		you may interact and communicate and cooperate
		with the merchant as you please but please listen to the merchant
		as i have very nice things to say and maybe you shall receive
		receive what you may ask? that i cannot say and i cannot answer
		for that would give it away, and i, the merchant enjoy my things,
		i love my things in any form they are and may seem to take
		and those things may be solid and liquid and gas,
		those things may include material and mental and emotional,
		and those things include and are not limited to anything i have not said
		for the merchant has and wants and needs many things,
		and if it is you that may stumble upon and walk into my shop,
		my store, my market, my emporium,
		then i shall present to you the space as the space welcomes thee,
		and i shall welcome you with open arms spread as wide as arms can spread open
		because in this establishment that is to be constructed
		you may, in thought presently and in fact futurely,
		enter the merchants shop and where the wares are there
		and those wares in which i care for are openly available to view
		to me, you, and everyone and anyone else who happen to come,
		so please, and please i mean,
		visit the merchant, who is i, in the merchantâ€™s store, very soon
		at some set specific time in the situated near future to come
		because that time which comes and comes as it may,
		may be the final finalized version of the shop which may never be seen again.
