	hey everyone what is up im <i><b>craig stam</b></i>(atelaky) and i think i might consider myself <i><b>a multi-media artist</b></i> but i am definitely 100% <i><b>a liar</i></b>. i work primarily in <i><b>new media/video/performance</i></b>, but once in a while i do enjoy doing other things which may or may not consist of the same or different things or whatever may be in between. i am <i><b>from staten island, new york</i></b> but am <i><b>currently in chicago, illinois</i></b> (which does not have pizza quite as good as in new york) for my <i><b>bfa</i></b> at the location/place/<i><b>school of the art institute of chicago</i></b> (saic.) if you would like to contact me for any reason that is not detrimental to my skincare routine, i am available to email at <i><b>cstama@saic.edu</i></b>. for inquiries which are detrimental to my skincare routine, i am still available at the same email but i would prefer not to be contacted with those offers in mind, thank you. my social media links are situated below this block of text- feel free to click the links which lead to them and follow/like/subscribe/add them if you so desire.
