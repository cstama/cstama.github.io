		<b>"</b><i>it is finally that time it is time for it now and it shall be revealed<br>
		please join me and myself and the individual which so happens to be i<br>
		in the great establishment that is opening<br>
		yes! the grand opening of said establishment is happening soon<br>
		and within that beforehand which it is not open it shall be in progress-<br>
		a process which requires the need to be set up, organized, arranged, rearranged,<br>
		sorted out, classified, categorized, grouped, ungrouped,<br>
		and systematically and algorithmically positioned<br>
		but when the actions and operations leading up to the finality<br>
		of the final conclusion are completed and finished you may be able to partake<br>
		in the larger scheme of the entire thing which will exist<br>
		as you are, i am, and the rest of everyone and everything else does as well<br>
		but right up until that point in time it will not be finished<br>
		and i hope you happen to be as excited for this as i am explaining this to you<br>
		because this fine establishment, this formation of business shall include you,<br>
		you there and you there, with me there, there as i am<br>
		you may interact and communicate and cooperate<br>
		with the merchant as you please but please listen to the merchant<br>
		as i have very nice things to say and maybe you shall receive<br>
		receive what you may ask? that i cannot say and i cannot answer<br>
		for that would give it away, and i, the merchant enjoy my things,<br>
		i love my things in any form they are and may seem to take<br>
		and those things may be solid and liquid and gas,<br>
		those things may include material and mental and emotional,<br>
		and those things include and are not limited to anything i have not said<br>
		for the merchant has and wants and needs many things,<br>
		and if it is you that may stumble upon and walk into my shop,<br>
		my store, my market, my emporium,<br>
		then i shall present to you the space as the space welcomes thee,<br>
		and i shall welcome you with open arms spread as wide as arms can spread open<br>
		because in this establishment that is to be constructed<br>
		you may, in thought presently and in fact futurely,<br>
		enter the merchants shop and where the wares are there<br>
		and those wares in which i care for are openly available to view<br>
		to me, you, and everyone and anyone else who happen to come,<br>
		so please, and please i mean,<br>
		visit the merchant, who is i, in the merchantâ€™s store, very soon<br>
		at some set specific time in the situated near future to come<br>
		because that time which comes and comes as it may,<br>
		may be the final finalized version of the shop which may never be seen again.</i><b>"</b>
